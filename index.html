The compound's moderate solubility and optimized binding characteristics ensure that it remains effective in systemic circulation and at the cellular level, making it a potent inducer of apoptosis in cancers reliant on anti-apoptotic mechanisms.",
                alternative: "AGI-413 could be explored in combination therapies with other apoptosis-inducing agents, such as BH3 mimetics or chemotherapy, to enhance its efficacy. The compound's ability to stabilize pro-apoptotic proteins suggests it could be particularly effective in overcoming resistance mechanisms in cancers that evade apoptosis. Additionally, the difluoromethoxy group offers opportunities for further structural modifications that could improve selectivity for specific Bcl-2 family members or enhance tissue specificity, potentially expanding the therapeutic applications of AGI-413 to a broader range of cancer types.",
